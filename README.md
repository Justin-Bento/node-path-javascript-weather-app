# Project: Weather App

This is the third project within the JavaScript Course for The Odin Project. Its goal is to help me get familiar with using everything weâ€™ve been discussing to create a weather forecast site using the Visual Crossing API. You should be able to search for a specific location and toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius.

## Features

- Search for a location and get the current weather.
- Display the weather data in either Fahrenheit or Celsius.
- Toggle between the two units of temperature.
- Fetch weather information from the Visual Crossing API.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Visual Crossing API

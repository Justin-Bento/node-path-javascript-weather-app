# Project: Weather App

The goal of this project is to create a weather forecast site using the Visual Crossing API. While I'll be using code from previous lessons taught by The Odin Project in their Full Stack Javascript course. Starting this project will help me gain practical experience using Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs and dynamic data in real world scenarios.

- Started: 25th January 2025

## Project Features

- Create the functions that hit the API and log the data
- Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
- Set up a form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).
- Display the information on your webpage!
- Add any styling you like!
- add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API.

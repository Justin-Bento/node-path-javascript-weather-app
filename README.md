# Project: Weather App

The goal is to create a weather forecast site using the Visual Crossing API from previous lessons inside The Odin Project. Website's features include:

- Create the functions that hit the API and log the data
- Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
- Set up a form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).
- Display the information on your webpage!
- Add any styling you like!
- add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API.

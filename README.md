# Project: Weather App

This is the third project within the JavaScript Course for The Odin Project. Its goal is to help me get familiar with using everything weâ€™ve been discussing to create a weather forecast site using the Visual Crossing API. You should be able to search for a specific location and toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius.
